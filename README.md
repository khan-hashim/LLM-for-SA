Exploring the idea of using Large Language Models and Generative AI models like ChatGPT to design software architectures using textual descriptions of the system by utilizing architecture and design patterns and considering functional and non-functional criteria

Key Take aways from "Towards Human-Bot Colloborative Software Architecting with ChatGPT"
The paper divides the process of driving software architecture into two parts 
1. Developing the Architecture Story i.e the textual description of the system we are trying to make
2. Colloborative Architecting i.e coming up with an architecture for the system.

The architecturing process is divided into 3 steps 
1. Architectural analysis i.e coming up with the functional, non-functional requirements and constraints for the story.
2. Architectural synthesis i.e coming up with the model of the system to help visualize the strucural decompostion of the system.
3. Architectural evaluation i.e evaluates the synthesized architecture.
