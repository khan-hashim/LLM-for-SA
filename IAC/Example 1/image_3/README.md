The AI struggles to identify all services in the image due to several key factors. First, the complexity of the diagram, with its densely packed and overlapping components and relationships, makes it challenging to distinguish individual services and their connections. Second, the model (gpt4o) used to analyze the image is not explicitly designed for diagram readability, limiting its ability to interpret abstract visual representations accurately. Finally, the use of non-standard design patterns in the diagram, which deviate from conventional formats like UML, introduces additional ambiguity. These issues combined reduce the AI's ability to fully dissect and understand the image.
